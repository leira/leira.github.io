# SFV - Ryu - Episode One - The Fireball Game

I really liked [Total Sagat](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1jpv-Iqp6hIptIra1BlXuw)'s
SF5 - Ryu series tutorials. But I found the the video format is not the easiest way to
follow, so I changed them into a blog posts. All credit goes to Total Sagat, I merely
changed the format of the content.

Original video of this post can be foun [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nLHr5ISdDw)

## Neutral: "Having no strongly marked or positive characteristics or features"

Let's think about our advantage with a fireball from the neutral position. How
likely are we to score damage from this distance?

What would be the risk to our character?

Fireball: 60 damage, unlikely to hit.

Jump in: A minimum of 230 damage

Some basic poker talk - our odds?

Worse than 4-1. We will have to risk slightly more than 4 long range fireballs
to win against one jump in - not good.

This range is more of a "protection" zone rather than a way to get damage. Shots
from here should be staggered with long pauses and baits.

Our highest risk zone.

It's better to think of fireballs as your longest poke rather than a long ranged
bullet.

The opponent must have a reason to push a button in closer proximity. You must
make them think they can hit you before fireballs really become effective.

Let's look at a match invloving Daigo, a master at the fireball game.

The red line represents the neutral distance, the green line represents a closer
poking distance.

Watch where Daigo scores damage and more importantly where he loses life.

[![Daigo fireball as poke](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/QuestionableJubilantAnnelid-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/QuestionableJubilantAnnelid)

As you can see Daigo lost the majority of his life from losing the neutral gamble
with fareballs.

He gained most of his damage from the closer "Poking" fireballs.

Generally, unless the character has a high jump arc and be easily anti aired, long
ranged neutral fireballs should be used sparingly.

Study your own replay matches - where are you losing a lot of your fireball game
damage and momentum?

Most likely from these risky longer ranged options.

**Remember - think of the fireball as a long poke and not as a seperate part of your
character.**


## Bait: "To entice or provoke, especially by trikery or strategy"

The "neutral" distance then should be your main anti air focus - meduim punk DP
for normal jumps and Ryu's stand heavy kick for longer ranged.

You can bait this range with subtle movements and teach your opponent not to jump.
AA damage is free damage.

Think about what happens when you move backwards - the opponent will want to move
forwards...

[![AA](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/PopularWhichBrownbutterfly-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/PopularWhichBrownbutterfly)

Fireballs carry a disadvantage - long startup. Therefore you should never use two
long start up moves together - namely a backwards dash or a jump.

Notice how eveytime Tokido dashes backwards, he pauses for a second to whiff a
normal. The two reasons for this are:

- He doesn't want to be at frame disadvantage for too long
- He's trying to bate the opponent into jumping or advancing

[![Tokido - backdash](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlushingFortunateHerald-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/BlushingFortunateHerald)

Another important point about fire all disadvantage :

You should rarely come out of block stun and throw a fireball on the first available
frame - again tis strings up two long start up events together and renders your
character immobile for too long.

A simple exampe would be like this:

[![Negative Frames](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EminentTiredAcornwoodpecker-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/EminentTiredAcornwoodpecker)

Instead gain control of your character our of the block stun and wait just a touch
to see events unfold -

These pauses betwen events are important to establish what's happening on screen.

Watch how Tokido uses this gambit to his advantage against Julio in the following
example. Instead of waiting Julio opts to throw immediately -

It costs him the entire round. The momentum shift from one bad throw can be massive.

Beware of the meaty fireball!

A good way to gain some push back and screen space is to hit the opponent with a
fireball just as they rise. It also gets some free chip damage.

These situations can also cost you more than you bargained for. Always check your
opponents resourses!

Watch how daigo opts for a whiff with st.LK. He knows that Cammy can spiral arrow
through a fireball if she quick rises. If not he can continue pressure with other
options.

## Buffering: "Temporary storage of data that is waiting to be sent"

Because fireballs have a long startup, one of the most effective ways to use them
is to cancel the fireball from a normal with quicker start up frames - usually Ryu's
cr.MP or cr.MK.

However you don't need to be in range for these normals to cancel, if you inpurt
the fireball motion behind your normal, you can catch the out stretched limb of
the opponent from a range that was further than your reach.

Bonchan knows the Chun Li player wants to poke from a longer range than he can
reach, so he waits outside the danger zone and buffers the normal into fireballs.

The results can be devastating.

## The hard facts:

1. LP fireball: 13 frames startup, 32 recovery, -7 on guard. 55 frames on screen.
1. MP fireball: 13 frames startup, 34 recovery, -7 on guard. 46 frames on screen.
1. HP fireball: 13 frames startup, 35 recovery, -7 on guard. 40 frames on screen.
1. EX fireball: 11 frames startup, 33 recovery, -2 on guard. 36 frames on screen.

[![Hard Facts](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CloseChubbyAvians-size_restricted.gif)](https://gfycat.com/CloseChubbyAvians)

This makes LP fireball the best zoning tool due to its faster recovery. MP sits
in an akward spot whilist HP is clearly the winner for speed at close range.

Ex fireball is very good due to its safer on blocker data, faster startup, its
ability to knock down and set up meaty attackers.


## Block strings

1. cr.MK xx fireball - not true
2. cr.MP xx fireball - true
3. cr.MK xx fireball - doesn't always combo on hit! (furthest range)
4. Point blank non EX fireball is punishable on block

## Juggle Points

1. V-Trigger, 2x EX corner juggle - most ranges
2. V-Trigger, regular charge - 59 frames, guard breaks
3. V-Trigger, EX charge - 40 frames, guard breaks
4. V-Trigger, regular LP fireball - super juggle, unlikely to use this
5. Regular fireball - AA juggle
6. Crush counter juggles
7. V-Trigger, Critical Art breaks guard

## "Diligence is the mother of good fortune"

Having a good fireball game takes hard work, but having no fear whilst thinking
about your situation whill ensure you control matches better.

Don't get disheartend wit "jump ins" and moves that beat fireballs, just make
sure you think about the situation at hand and it will come with time. You will
instinctively start to realise good and bad choices.

Remeber even the threat of a fireball is a powerful weapon. If poor players opt
to by pass your fireball game - you don't need one - you just need to make sure
you bait and counter their attempts.

Why try to zone when you don't need to?

Goodluch with your fireball game!!!

Next time - [Episode 2 - Meatys and Pressure]({{ site.baseurl }}{% 2017-03-15-SF5-Ryu-EP2-The-Meaty-Game %}).



## Take aways

1. Use fireball as your longest poke, use it in closer Poking range.
2. Focus on Anti-Air in "Neutral range", rather than fireball, using subtle
movement to bait jump.
3. Don't throw fireball right after backwards dash or jump, don't throw fireball
right after come out of block stun. It reders your character immobile for too long.
4. Always buffer cr.MP into fireball.
